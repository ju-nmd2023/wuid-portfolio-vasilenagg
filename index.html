          My name is Vasilena Georgieva. I am 19 years old and I am from
          Plovdiv, Bulgaria. I studied computer graphics as a high school major
          in Bulgaria. Hence, I have been acquiring the skills of a graphic
          designer for 5 years now and by being exposed to creativity and
          originality and having participated in many group projects including
          an Erasmus programme in Catania, Italy (working for a company called
          Euromecc), I learned to draw inspiration from all of my surroundings.
          Additionally, I have completed two internships in the areas of graphic
          design and printing. I worked as a graphic designer in the advertising
          sector for a local furniture company where my job was heavily oriented
          towards digital media - digital brochures and web banners. I am
          currently studying New Media Design in Jönköping University, Sweden.
